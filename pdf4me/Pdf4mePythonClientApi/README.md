## Getting Started

To get started get a Token by dropping us an email (support-dev@pdf4me.com) or registering in our portal (https://portal.pdf4me.com/).

The Token is required for Basic Authentication. The Pdf4me Client Api provides you already with the necessary implementation. You need only to get an instance for the Pdf4meClient as shown in the sample below.

```python
"""
Either you store them in the config.properties file with token 
Do not use any quotes:
Correct: token=sample-not-working-key-aaaaaaa
Incorrect: token="sample-not-working-key-aaaaaaa"

In case the location of your config.properties differs from the default location ('../config.properties'), provide the optional argument path_to_config_file.

"""
pdf4me_client = Pdf4meClient(path_to_config_file='path_to_my_config.properties')

""" or you pass them as arguments when constructing the Pdf4meClient object """
pdf4me_client = Pdf4meClient(token=token)

# The pdf4meClient object delivers the necessary authentication when instantiating the different pdf4meClients such as for instance Merge
merge_client = MergeClient(pdf4me_client)
merged_pdf = merge_client.merge_2_pdfs(
    file1=FileReader().get_file_handler(path='my_first_pdf.pdf'),
    file2=FileReader().get_file_handler(path='my_second_pdf.pdf')
)
```

## Recommendation

It's recommended to create an instance of `Pdf4meClient` per thread in a multithreaded environment to avoid any potential issues.
